        <p>Disease Classification is the task of assigning diagnoses to electronic health records and clinical free-text notes. Medical professionals often have to assign diagnostic codes representing such diagnoses to health records for various purposes, such as for hospital billing or for tracking treatments. Automating this process can help reduce clinician burnout and alleviate administrative burdens on hospital staff. Hence, we present this shared task on automatically classifying diseases using radiology reports and discharge summaries. </p>

          <p>Participants are given a dataset based on MIMIC-IV which includes 265,218 valid admissions (samples will be pre-split into training, validation, and hidden test sets). A valid admission is defined as an admission where the patient has one (1) primary diagnosis ICD code (either ICD-9 or ICD-10), one (1) discharge summary, and at least one (1) radiology report. Due to the high number of unique ICD codes across the two vocabulary versions present in this dataset, we have grouped the primary diagnosis ICD codes into PheCodes using the ICD-to-Phecode maps provided by PheWAS (code for this mapping is provided). </p>

          <blockquote>
          <p>All participants will be invited to write a paper describing their solution that will be included in the Proceedings of the 22st Workshop on Biomedical Language Processing. If you do not wish to write a paper, you must at least provide a thorough description of your system that will be included in the overview paper of the task. Otherwise, your submission (or reported scores) will not be taken into account.</p>
